# Language Support

Parca agent currently supports all compiled languages, e.g. C, C++, Rust, Go (with extended support for Go).


[Further language support](https://github.com/parca-dev/parca-agent/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature%2Flanguage-support), for just-in-time (JIT) compilers and dynamic languages, is coming in the upcoming weeks and months.
